Provisional fork of eponymous repo angular-actioncable that you get with bower install.

Changed primarily because the original ActionCableConfig class doesn't work very well. ActionCableWebsocket had to be overridden to allow dynamic change of websocket URL. Maybe there will be a pull request, who knows?
